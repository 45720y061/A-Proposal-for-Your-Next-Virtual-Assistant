# A Message for You

Hi Yehoshua,

What you're doing isn’t simple. You’re juggling time zones, communication gaps, and the kind of operational chaos that comes with building across continents.

That’s exactly the kind of work I support.

I build the systems that make remote teams smoother to run. Things like Zapier-based onboarding flows, POS setups tailored to each market, and back-office automation that removes noise. My focus is always the same: reduce friction so the people driving the mission can actually focus on it.

I’m based in Peru, so I know the LatAm business environment firsthand. I’m fluent in both Spanish and English (C2 certified), and my experience spans project coordination, automation, CRM setup, and visual documentation for distributed teams.

This repository is a snapshot of how I work. It includes examples, not fluff.

If what you need is someone who can quietly make your operation faster, cleaner, and easier to manage.
I’d like to talk.

Best,  
**Italo Argote**
