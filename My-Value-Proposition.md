## How I Can Add Value Right Away

- **LatAm operational context**  
  I’m based in Peru and have experience working with U.S. and Latin American teams.  
  I understand how business gets done here — culturally, technically, and logistically — which means less onboarding and fewer surprises.

- **Bilingual communication, handled**  
  I don’t just speak both languages — I’m certified in remote interpreting.  
  That means smoother calls, clearer handoffs, and fewer costly miscommunications between your Israeli team and Latin American clients.

- **Automation where it matters**  
  I look for the repeatable parts of your workflow and set up systems to handle them — using Zapier, Notion, ClickUp, and CRM tools.  
  The goal is to free up time and reduce dependency on manual work.

- **Hands-on across tools**  
  I work end to end: CRM updates, POS configuration, onboarding steps, reports in Excel or Python — whatever keeps operations clean and consistent.

- **Real impact**  
  In past roles, I’ve helped reduce manual work by 40%, cut install time by 60%, and lowered error rates in logistics workflows by 25%.  
  These aren't estimates — they’re outcomes.
