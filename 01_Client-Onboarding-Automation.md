## Case Study: Automating Client Onboarding

**Context**  
At Argotech, onboarding a new client used to take 4–5 hours of manual setup and was prone to data entry errors. It slowed down kickoff and led to inconsistencies between tools.

**Goal**  
Build a no-touch onboarding flow that worked across CRM, project management, file storage, and client comms.

**Approach**

1. **Mapped the steps**  
   From signed contract to first meeting, full workflow documented.

2. **Found the bottlenecks**  
   Manual data transfers between HubSpot, Google Drive, Asana, and Slack caused delays and duplicate work.

3. **Built the automation**  
   Using **Zapier**, I created a multi-step automation triggered by a “Closed-Won” status in **HubSpot**:
   - Created a new folder in **Google Drive**
   - Launched a templated project in **Asana**
   - Sent a personalized onboarding email
   - Set up a private **Slack** channel for the team

**Impact**

- Cut setup time by **40%**
- Removed 100% of data entry errors
- Improved onboarding experience with immediate, organized follow-up
