### Case Study: Digitizing a Supply Chain

**The Problem:** At Capriccio Miraflores SAC, the supply chain and inventory management process relied heavily on manual spreadsheets and paper records. This led to frequent stock discrepancies, inefficient ordering, and weak negotiating power with suppliers due to a lack of clear data.

**The Mission:** Lead the full digitization of the supply chain to improve accuracy, reduce costs, and provide data-driven insights for negotiations.

**My Process & Tools:**
1.  **System Audit:** I conducted a full audit of the existing manual process, identifying key failure points in stock counting, order placement, and goods receipt.
2.  **Solution Design:** I researched and selected a lean, effective **Inventory Management System (IMS)** suitable for our scale. The key was to find a tool that was powerful yet easy for the existing team to adopt.
3.  **Implementation & Training:** I personally led the implementation of the new IMS. This involved:
    *   Migrating all existing product and supplier data into the new system.
    *   Establishing clear, standardized procedures for inventory trackingâ€”from receiving to final sale.
    *   Training all relevant staff on how to use the new software and adhere to the new protocols.
4.  **Data-Driven Negotiation:** With accurate, real-time data on stock levels, turnover rates, and order history, I was able to renegotiate contracts with key suppliers, securing better payment terms and volume discounts.

**The Quantifiable Result:**
*   Reduced stock discrepancies by **25%** within the first six months.
*   Secured a **10% cost reduction** on key supplies through data-backed vendor negotiations.
*   Provided management with a real-time dashboard for inventory valuation and forecasting, enabling smarter purchasing decisions.
